# Overview
- This is "Community Authentication" smart contract for regarding Blockchain which made by Substrate.
- You can create Community which you belong to.
- You can create personal account and you join the community if the community member gives you to the permition.

# Motivation
- I think people will prefer peer-to-peer as the world becomes more decentralized.
- In a world where value is stored on the blockchain, people all over the world should be able to freely exchange value without intervening nations, public institutions and companies in each country.
- In that world, I think the notion of trust that modern humans rely on will be useless.
- I think the decentralized world will need a new decentralized concept of trust.
- In a world where anyone can send money to anyone in the world at a low fee through the blockchain, the marketplace will be democratized and anyone can build a market on the blockchain.
- Then how do we find a reliable trading partner among sellers around the world? Is it really possible to trust someone who has only chatted a few times or talked for hours on a video call?
- So, I thought of an attempt to restore an existing community on the blockchain and determine which community the person belongs to to determine whether it is reliable or not.
- This smart contract is still in the prototype stage. If you have any good ideas and would like to work with us, we would love to hear from you.
